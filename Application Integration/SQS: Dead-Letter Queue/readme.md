## Title
Simple Queue Service (SQS): Dead-Letter Queue

## Objective
Explain the purpose of SQS Dead-Letter Queue.

## Implementation
If a message fails to be processed (consumed) successfully by a consumer from a standard SQS queue, you can configure SQS to move that message to a Dead-Letter Queue. This helps in isolating problematic messages for further analysis and troubleshooting.

## Conclusion
The SQS Dead-Letter Queue is a crucial feature for maintaining message integrity and reliability in distributed applications. It provides a mechanism to isolate and handle messages that cannot be processed successfully due to errors or other issues, thereby aiding in system troubleshooting and improving overall message processing robustness.
