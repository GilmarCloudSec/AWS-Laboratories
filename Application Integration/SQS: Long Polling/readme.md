## Title
Simple Queue Service (SQS): Long Polling

## Objective
Describe SQS Long Polling.

## Implementation
Long Polling allows consumers to retrieve queue messages with lower latency and fewer API calls. If no messages are immediately available, the consumer waits for a specified time (wait time) for messages to arrive.

## Why Use Long Polling?
- **Reduced Latency:** Messages are delivered as soon as they become available, speeding up retrieval.
- **Cost Efficiency:** It lowers operational costs by reducing empty responses and unnecessary API calls.

## Conclusion
SQS Long Polling improves message retrieval by allowing consumers to wait for messages, reducing latency, optimizing API usage, and enhancing overall application performance in SQS-based systems.
